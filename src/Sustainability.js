        Eccel Recycling Private Limited's businesses are fully aligned with -
        and are in fact helping to drive - tomorrow's “circular economy”. As an
        alternative to the traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose), the
        idea of the circular economy is to keep resources in use for as long as
        possible; extract the maximum value from those resources while in use;
        and then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of
        their useful life.

                Almost 40% of the world's steel production is made from scrap.

                Recycling one tonne of steel saves 1,100 kilogrammes of iron
                ore, 630 kilogrammes of coal, and 55 kilogrammes of limestone.
              </li>
              <li>
                CO2 emissions are reduced by 58% through the use of ferrous
                scrap.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recycling one tonne of steel saves 642 kWh of energy, 1.8
                barrels (287 litres) of oil, 10.9 million Btu's of energy and
                2.3 cubic metres of landfill space.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recycling steel uses 75% less energy compared to creating steel
                from raw materials - enough to power 18 million homes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Steel recycling uses 74% less energy, 90% less virgin materials
                and 40% less water; it also produces 76% fewer water pollutants,
                86% fewer air pollutants and 97% less mining waste.
              </li>
              <li>
                Steel automobile frames contain at least 25% recycled steel and
                a typical electrical appliance will usually be made of 75%
                recycled steel. Steel cans consist of at least 25% recycled
                steel.
